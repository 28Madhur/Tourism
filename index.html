                    <td>Rajasthan is famous for textiles, semi-precious stones, and handicrafts, as well as for its traditional and colorful art. Rajasthani furniture is known for its intricate carvings and bright colours. Block prints, tie and dye prints, Bagaru prints, Sanganer prints and Zari embroidery are famous. Rajasthan is traditionally strong in textile products, handicrafts, gems and jewellery, dimensional stones, agro and food products. The top five export items ,which contributed for the two-third of exports from the state of Rajasthan are textiles (including ready made garments) gems & jewellery, engineering goods,chemical and allied products.[3] The blue pottery of Jaipur is particularly noted. With an intention of attracting investment for revival of traditional arts and crafts as well as promotion of cultural heritage, the first handicraft policy has been released in Rajasthan.[4].Rajasthan has large quantity of raw materials namely marbles, wood, leather to cash on the great potential for development of handicraft.</td>
